📘 Numerical Linear Algebra for Data Science & Machine Learning

A collection of projects applying numerical linear algebra techniques to real-world data science and machine learning problems.

🔍 Overview

This repository contains four applied projects demonstrating how numerical linear algebra supports modern data science, machine learning, and data mining tasks.
Each project implements core linear algebra algorithms from scratch and applies them to real datasets such as EMNIST, MNIST, and 20 Newsgroups.

Techniques explored include:

Eigenvalue problems

Power iteration

QR decomposition (Householder & incremental Givens)

Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF)

Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

t-SNE

Clustering metrics (ARI, AMI, Silhouette)

Sparse matrix operations

Graph algorithms (PageRank)
